# LanguageGuesser

Language Guesser exercise, from the course The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024 by Colt Steele

Exercise in using npm packages. 
In this exercise I used npm packages: franc, langs and colors. I created a language guesser app that takes text as input and tries to determine what language the text is. It returns either a language guess or a error message.
